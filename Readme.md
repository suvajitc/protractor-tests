## Protractor Test
This is built to demnstrate the use of **protractor** for test automation of **angular js** web applications, 
which includes **react js** also.

It uses the **Jasmine** framework and **Page Object Model**. 

### How to Run
1. Ensure that you have **NodeJs**, **npm** and **protractor** installed in your system.
2. In a **command prompt** or **terminal window**, start the selenium webdriver with the command:
`webdriver-manager start`
3. Download the code from git repository to any location `/path/to/files`
4. In another command prompt or terminal window, go to this location and execute the tests 
by running the following commands: 

`cd /path/to/files` or `cd C:\path\to\files`

`protractor ./conf/conf.js` or `protractor .\conf\conf.js`
